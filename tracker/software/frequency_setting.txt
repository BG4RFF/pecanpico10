Why does PP10 have frequency, step and channel parameters in config.c?

Firstly the ability to specify a frequency directly in the freq parameter of config.c has not changed.
Simply set freq in Hz to a desired frequency and leave step and channel set to 0.
Geofence frequencies remain unaffected as well since step and chan are set to 0 when using geofence.

Q: So why add step and chan?
A: The addition of step and chan is aimed at providing additional functionality in future features as follows...

A) A table of channels may be specified for scanning/seeking packet signals under software control.

B) The feature of the Si446x to automatically scan using a channel table is being investigated
 - This reduces the amount of control from the host MCU required to manage such a channel scanning application.
 - Automatic detection of packet channels would enable operation where GPS location is inactive.
 
C) The software base may be used for other than balloon projects or incorporate other bands, protocols and radios
 - It can be envisaged that a step and channel format could be useful in such instances.
 
D) Configuring the radio(s) won't usually be done by editing config.c directly.
 - In over the air or command line configuration changes the UI would not require user knowledge of the structure of config.c
 - Some settings may be better described by a band base frequency, a step size and a channel.
